## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **Meta Database Engineer Professional Certificate**.  
The lab demonstrates how to **create a new database and tables in MySQL directly from Python** using the MySQL Connector/Python API.  

👉 **Business relevance:**  
- Modern data analysts and engineers often need to **automate schema creation** for ETL pipelines, BI systems, or cloud data warehouses.  
- This workflow shows how to set up and structure databases in code — ensuring **repeatability, scalability, and automation**.

## 🗂️ Database Context  
- **Database created:** `little_lemon`  
- **Tables created in this project:**  
  - `Bookings`  
  - `Customers`  
  - `Orders`  

Each table has primary keys, constraints, and is ready for relational joins.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **MySQL Connector/Python** (`mysql.connector`)  
- **MySQL 8.0**

## 📈 Key Learnings
- How to establish a Python–MySQL connection with mysql.connector.
- How to create databases and tables programmatically.
- Importance of constraints (PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT).
- Ensuring reproducibility of database design via scripts instead of manual SQL.
